## Attendance

Anyone can come, but we will not be explicitly onboarding at Collab
Summit Berlin. Conversations can move fast as working groups have
a lot of context. This Spring instance of Collab Summit will not include
a morning Code + Learn to learn how to contribute prior to congregating
for the summit. Please look to the Fall Collab Summit in Vancouver, BC
for this pairing.

Working groups will put together a brief schedule so that people can
familiarize themselves before folks get onsite, having the general collaborator
discussions, and then dive into breakout sessions.

## Working groups in attendance

We'd love to know ahead who will be represented. Filing issues in this repo is helpful for discussion particular to a working group and how they'd like to manage their time. Linking to that here would be great! We're working on creating a Projects Board to post times for this on the conf agenda so people are aware of when a WG meets and can maybe get a break, if needed. We'll be looking at issues filed in this repo titled "Berlin: working group something something" to add these below as well.
- Working group that will be at Collaboration Summit
  - Name of contact @github-handle
  - link to working group planning issue
  - Any extra requests(space during conf, av/sound, etc.)

## Travel Fund
There are funds available for any Individual Member of the Node.js Foundation to receive travel funds to Collab Summit.  Membership is free for active collaborators. Sign up [HERE](https://github.com/nodejs/members#members).

PLEASE follow the instructions for application to receive travel funds [HERE](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/MEMBER_TRAVEL_FUND.md#process).

zoom or hangout.
